# 2020-projects 
I want to track and manage projects and goals for this year.

- Select a certificate to study for
    - CSSLP or ~~CISSP~~
      CISSP requires five years of experience and I am 15 months away and lacking broad experience. CSSLP will allow me to focus on           software security and architecture. The CSSLP certification only requires 4 years of experience and I am 3 months away which is a 
      good amount of time to study and review while reinforcing my knowledge.
