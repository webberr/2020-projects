# 2020-projects 
I want to track and manage projects and goals for this year. 

## Goals

Learning
- Reading List
  - "threat modeling - designing for security"
  - "CSSLP - Exam Guide"
- Learn Python

  - Python for Security Udemy Course
- Learn GatsbyJS
  - Create a Gatsby Website
  - Create a Gatsby Theme
  - Create a Gatsby Starter
- Select a certificate to study for
    - CSSLP or ~~CISSP~~
      CISSP requires five years of experience and I am 15 months away and lacking broad experience. CSSLP will allow me to focus on           software security and architecture. The CSSLP certification only requires 4 years of experience and I am 3 months away which is a 
      good amount of time to study and review while reinforcing my knowledge. 
    - ~~AWS Security Associate~~ or AWS Solutions Architect Associate
- Research security maturity evaluation
