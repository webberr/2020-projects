Overview

This project is an opportunity to learn Python and produce some results valuable to Shopify users and learn more about page crawling. 
I will start to define the process manually and research the location of the theme name value for a shopify website. There are many examples of top X lists
of shopify sites to start from. 


- Create a script to produce a list of shopify sites
- crawl each site to identify the theme
- run a speedtest on the site
- store speedtest results by theme
- present the data
